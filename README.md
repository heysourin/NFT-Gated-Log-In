# NFT-Gated Log In System

This is a web application built using Next.js and Ethereum smart contract to create a login system that requires a specific non-fungible token (NFT) in the user's wallet to access the "welcome" page. If the user does not have the required NFT, they are directed to an "access denied" page.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js version 12 or above
- A web3-enabled browser (e.g. MetaMask)
- A Ethereum testnet account with some ETH and the required NFT in the wallet on smart contract we are using.


## Installation

    1. Clone this repository
    2. Install dependencies: npm install
    3. Start the Next.js development server: npm run dev

## Benefits

- Increased security
- Enhanced user experience
- Potential for incentivization
- Unique branding opportunities
- Community building
